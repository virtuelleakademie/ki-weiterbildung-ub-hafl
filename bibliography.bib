  abstract = {Modeling students' knowledge is a fundamental part of online learning platforms. Knowledge tracing is an application of student modeling which renowned for its ability to trace students' knowledge. Knowledge tracing ability can be used in online learning platforms for predicting learning performance and providing adaptive learning. Due to the wide uses of knowledge tracing in student modeling, this study aims to understand the state-of-the-art and future research of knowledge tracing. This study focused on reviewing 24 studies published between 2017 to the third quarter of 2021 in four digital databases. The selected studies have been filtered using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Several previous studies have shown that there are two approaches used in knowledge tracing, including probabilistic and deep learning. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model is the most widely used in the probabilistic approach, while the Deep Knowledge Tracing model is the most popular model in the deep learning approach. Meanwhile, ASSISTments 2009–2010 is the most frequently tested dataset for probabilistic and deep learning approaches. In the future, additional studies are required to explore several models which have been developed previously. Therefore this study provides direction for future research of each existing approach.},

  abstract = {Proposes a framework for skill acquisition that includes 2 major stages in the development of a cognitive skill: (1) a declarative stage in which facts about the skill domain are interpreted and (2) a procedural stage in which the domain knowledge is directly embodied in procedures for performing the skill. This general framework has been instantiated in the ACT system in which facts are encoded in a propositional network and procedures are encoded as productions. Knowledge compilation is the process by which the skill transits from the declarative stage to the procedural stage. It consists of the subprocesses of composition, which collapses sequences of productions into single productions, and proceduralization, which embeds factual knowledge into productions. Once proceduralized, further learning processes operate on the skill to make the productions more selective in their range of applications. These processes include generalization, discrimination, and strengthening of productions. Comparisons are made to similar concepts from previous learning theories. How these learning mechanisms apply to produce the power law speedup in processing time with practice is discussed. (62 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Rather than adhering to the typical practice in cognitive psychology of trying to predict behavior from a model of cognitive mechanisms, this book develops a number of models that successfully predict behavior from the structure of the environment to which cognition is adapted. The methodology -- called rational analysis -- involves specifying the information-processing goals of the system, the structure of the environment, and the computational constraints on the system, allowing predictions about behavior to be made by determining what behavior would be optimal under these assumptions. The Adaptive Character of Thought applies this methodology in great detail to four cognitive phenomena: memory, categorization, causal inference, and problem solving.},

Distinguished from the original theory in three ways, this volume uses the rational analyses of Anderson (1990) to improve upon that theory and extend its scope. It also relates the theory to a great deal of new data on the performance and acquisition of cognitive skills.   The new theory -- ACT-R -- involves a neurally plausible implementation of a production system architecture. Rational analysis is used to structure and parameterize the system to yield optimal information processing. The theory is applicable to a wide variety of research disciplines, including memory, problem solving, and skill acquisition. Using intelligent tutors, much of the data is concerned with the acquisition of cognitive skills. The book provides analyses of data sets describing the extended course of the acquisition of mathematical and computer programming skills.},

In this paper, we provide a brief history of knowledge tracing model research and introduce pyBKT, an accessible and computationally efficient library of model extensions from the literature. The library provides data generation, fitting, prediction, and cross-validation routines, as well as a simple to use data helper interface to ingest typical tutor log dataset formats. We evaluate the runtime with various dataset sizes and compare to past implementations. Additionally, we conduct sanity checks of the model using experiments with simulated data to evaluate the accuracy of its EM parameter learning and use real-world data to validate its predictions, comparing pyBKT’s supported model variants with results from the papers in which they were originally introduced. The library is open source and open license for the purpose of making knowledge tracing more accessible to communities of research and practice and to facilitate progress in the field through easier replication of past approaches.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize how humans work, and has already demonstrated promise in significantly improving human productivity. However, a key remaining question is how generative AI affects learning, namely, how humans acquire new skills as they perform tasks. This kind of skill learning is critical to long-term productivity gains, especially in domains where generative AI is fallible and human experts must check its outputs. We study the impact of generative AI, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4, on human learning in the context of math classes at a high school. In a field experiment involving nearly a thousand students, we have deployed and evaluated two GPT based tutors, one that mimics a standard ChatGPT interface (called GPT Base) and one with prompts designed to safeguard learning (called GPT Tutor). These tutors comprise about 15\% of the curriculum in each of three grades. Consistent with prior work, our results show that access to GPT-4 significantly improves performance (48\% improvement for GPT Base and 127\% for GPT Tutor). However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never had access (17\% reduction for GPT Base). That is, access to GPT-4 can harm educational outcomes. These negative learning effects are largely mitigated by the safeguards included in GPT Tutor. Our results suggest that students attempt to use GPT-4 as a "crutch" during practice problem sessions, and when successful, perform worse on their own. Thus, to maintain long-term productivity, we must be cautious when deploying generative AI to ensure humans continue to learn critical skills.    * HB, OB, and AS contributed equally},

However, these parameter estimates make different claims, some of which are clearly incorrect, about the student’s unobservable internal knowledge. We propose methods for evaluating these models to find ones that are more plausible. Specifically, we present an approach using Dirichlet priors to bias model search that results in a statistically reliable improvement in predictive accuracy (AUC of 0.620 ± 0.002 vs. 0.614 ± 0.002). Furthermore, the parameters associated with this model provide more plausible estimates of student learning, and better track with known properties of students’ background knowledge. The main conclusion is that prior beliefs are necessary to bias the student modeling search, and even large quantities of performance data alone are insufficient to properly estimate the model.},

  abstract = {The basic problem learners confront is that we can easily be misled as to whether we are learning effectively and have or have not achieved a level of learning and comprehension that will support our subsequent access to information or skills we are trying to learn. We can be misled by our subjective impressions. Rereading a chapter a second time, for example, can provide a sense of familiarity or perceptual fluency that we interpret as understanding or comprehension, but may actually be a product of low-level perceptual priming. Similarly, information coming readily to mind can be interpreted as evidence of learning, but could instead be a product of cues that are present in the study situation, but that are unlikely to be present at a later time. We can also be misled by our current performance. Conditions of learning that make performance improve rapidly often fail to support long-term retention and transfer, whereas conditions that create challenges and slow the rate of apparent learning often optimize long-term retention and transfer. At a theoretical level, we (Bjork \& Bjork, 1992) distinguish between the storage strength and the retrieval strength of information or skills stored in memory. Storage strength reflects how entrenched or interassociated a memory representation is with related knowledge and skills, whereas retrieval strength reflects the current activation or accessibility of that representation and is heavily influenced by factors such as situational cues and recency of study or exposure. Importantly, we assume that current performance is entirely a function of current retrieval strength, but that storage strength acts to retard the loss (forgetting) and enhance the gain (relearning) of retrieval strength. The key idea for present purposes is that conditions that most rapidly increase retrieval strength differ from the conditions that maximize the gain of storage strength. In other words, if learners interpret current retrieval strength as storage strength, they become susceptible to preferring poorer conditions of learning to better conditions of learning. So what are these better conditions of learning that, while apparently creating difficulty, actually lead to more durable and flexible learning? Such desirable difficulties (Bjork, 1994) include varying the conditions of learning, rather than keeping them constant and predictable; interleaving instruction on separate topics, rather than grouping instruction by topic (called blocking); spacing, rather than massing, study sessions on a given topic; and using tests, rather than presentations, as study events.

  abstract = {A central characteristic of Bayesian statistics is the ability to consistently incorporate prior knowledge into various modeling processes. In this paper, we focus on translating domain expert knowledge into corresponding prior distributions over model parameters, a process known as prior elicitation. Expert knowledge can manifest itself in diverse formats, including information about raw data, summary statistics, or model parameters. A major challenge for existing elicitation methods is how to effectively utilize all of these different formats in order to formulate prior distributions that align with the expert's expectations, regardless of the model structure. To address these challenges, we develop a simulation-based elicitation method that can learn the hyperparameters of potentially any parametric prior distribution from a wide spectrum of expert knowledge using stochastic gradient descent. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of our elicitation method in four representative case studies covering linear models, generalized linear models, and hierarchical models. Our results support the claim that our method is largely independent of the underlying model structure and adaptable to various elicitation techniques, including quantile-based, moment-based, and histogram-based methods.},

  abstract = {The international bestseller that has helped millions of students, teachers, and lifelong learners use proven approaches to learn better and remember longer. “We have made Make It Stick a touchstone for our instructors … to gain a real advantage for our learners as they tackle some of the toughest work in the world.” ―Carl Czech, former Senior Instructional Systems Specialist/Advisor, US Navy SEALsAre you tired of forgetting what you learn? This groundbreaking book, based on the latest research in cognitive science, offers powerful strategies to boost memory and learning. To most of us, learning something “the hard way” means wasted time and effort. Good teaching, many believe, should be tailored to the different learning styles of students and should use strategies that make learning easier. Make It Stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and a ten-year collaboration among some of the world’s leading experts on human learning and memory, the authors explain what really drives successful learning. With clear, real-world examples, they show how we can confidently hone our skills and learn more effectively.Many common study habits simply don’t work. Underlining, highlighting, rereading, cramming, and single-minded repetition of new skills create the illusion of mastery, but gains fade quickly. Science shows that more durable learning comes from self-testing, introducing certain difficulties in practice, waiting to re-study new material until a little forgetting has occurred, and interleaving the practice of one skill or topic with another. Make It Stick breaks down these proven approaches in compelling ways and offers concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners. Full of eye-opening and inspiring stories for students, educators, and parents, Make It Stick is an indispensable guide for all those interested in the challenge of lifelong learning and self-improvement.},

  abstract = {This study aims to introduce Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), a probabilistic model used in educational data mining to estimate learners’ knowledge states over time. It also provides a practical guide to estimating BKT models using the pyBKT library available in Python. The first section presents an overview of BKT by explaining its theoretical foundations and advantages in modeling individual learning processes. In the second section, we describe different variants of the standard BKT model based on item response theory (IRT). Next, we demonstrate the estimation of BKT with the pyBKT library in Python, outlining data pre-processing steps, parameter estimation, and model evaluation. Different cases of knowledge tracing tasks illustrate how BKT estimates learners’ knowledge states and evaluates prediction accuracy. The results highlight the utility of BKT in capturing learners’ knowledge states dynamically. We also show that the model parameters of BKT resemble the parameters from logistic IRT models.},

  abstract = {Knowledge tracing (KT) enhances student learning by leveraging past performance to predict future performance. Current research utilizes models based on attention mechanisms and recurrent neural network structures to capture long-term dependencies and correlations between exercises, aiming to improve model accuracy. Due to the growing amount of data in smart education scenarios, this poses a challenge in terms of time and space consumption for knowledge tracing models. However, existing research often overlooks the efficiency of model training and inference and the constraints of training resources. Recognizing the significance of prioritizing model efficiency and resource usage in knowledge tracing, we introduce Mamba4KT. This novel model is the first to explore enhanced efficiency and resource utilization in knowledge tracing. We also examine the interpretability of the Mamba structure both sequence-level and exercise-level to enhance model interpretability. Experimental findings across three public datasets demonstrate that Mamba4KT achieves comparable prediction accuracy to state-of-the-art models while significantly improving training and inference efficiency and resource utilization. As educational data continues to grow, our work suggests a promising research direction for knowledge tracing that improves model prediction accuracy, model efficiency, resource utilization, and interpretability simultaneously.},

  abstract = {Learning involves the integration of new information into existing knowledge. Generating explanations to oneself (self-explaining) facilitates that integration process. Previously, self-explanation has been shown to improve the acquisition of problem-solving skills when studying worked-out examples. This study extends that finding, showing that self-explanation can also be facilitative when it is explicitly promoted, in the context of learning declarative knowledge from an expository text. Without any extensive training, 14 eighth-grade students were merely asked to self-explain after reading each line of a passage on the human circulatory system. Ten students in the control group read the same text twice, but were not prompted to self-explain. All of the students were tested for their circulatory system knowledge before and after reading the text. The prompted group had a greater gain from the pretest to the posttest. Moreover, prompted students who generated a large number of self-explanations (the high explainers) learned with greater understanding than low explainers. Understanding was assessed by answering very complex questions and inducing the function of a component when it was only implicitly stated. Understanding was further captured by a mental model analysis of the self-explanation protocols. High explainers all achieved the correct mental model of the circulatory system, whereas many of the unprompted students as well as the low explainers did not. Three processing characteristics of self-explaining are considered as reasons for the gains in deeper understanding.},

APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.},

To make sense of the wide Knowledge tracing (KT) modeling landscape, this paper conducts a systematic review to provide a detailed and nuanced discussion of relevant KT techniques from the perspective of assumptions, data, and algorithms. The results show that most existing KT models consider only a fragment of the assumptions that relate to the knowledge components within items and student’s cognitive process. Almost all types of KT models take “quize data” as input, although it is insufficient to reflect a clear picture of students’ learning process. Dynamic Bayesian network, logistic regression and deep learning are the main algorithms used by various knowledge tracing models.

  abstract = {Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has generated excitement and concern in education. While cross-sectional studies have highlighted correlations between ChatGPT use and learning performance, they fall short of establishing causality. This review examines experimental studies on ChatGPT's impact on student learning to address this gap. A comprehensive search across five databases identified 69 articles published between 2022 and 2024 for analysis. The findings reveal that ChatGPT interventions are predominantly implemented at the university level, cover various subject areas focusing on language education, are integrated into classroom environments as part of regular educational practices, and primarily involve direct student use of ChatGPT. Overall, ChatGPT improves academic performance, affective-motivational states, and higher-order thinking propensities; it reduces mental effort and has no significant effect on self-efficacy. However, methodological limitations, such as the lack of power analysis and concerns regarding post-intervention assessments, warrant cautious interpretation of results. This review presents four propositions from the findings: (1) distinguish between the quality of ChatGPT outputs and the positive effects of interventions on academic performance by shifting from well-defined problems in post-intervention assessments to more complex, project-based assessments that require skill demonstration, adopting proctored assessments, or incorporating metrics such as originality alongside quality; (2) evaluate long-term impacts to determine whether the positive effects on affective-motivational states are sustained or merely owing to novelty effect; (3) prioritise objective measures to complement subjective assessments of higher-order thinking; and (4) use power analysis to determine adequate sample sizes to avoid Type II errors and provide reliable effect size estimates. This review provides valuable insights for researchers, instructors, and policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of generative AI integration in educational practice.},

In many nonindustrializednations apprenticeship remains thepredominantmethodof teaching and learning. However, the overall concept of learning from experts through social interactions is not one that should be relegated to vocational and trade-based training while K-12 and higher educational institutions seek to prepare students for operating in an information-based society.

  abstract = {Few models have been more ubiquitous in their respective fields than Bayesian knowledge tracing and item response theory. Both these models were developed to analyze data on learners. However, the study designs that these models are designed for differ; Bayesian knowledge tracing is designed to analyze longitudinal data while item response theory is built for cross-sectional data. This paper illustrates a fundamental connection between these two models. Specifically, the stationary distribution of the latent variable and the observed response variable in Bayesian knowledge Tracing are related to an item response theory model. This connection between these two models highlights a key missing component: the role of education in these models. A research agenda is outlined which answers how to move forward with modeling learner data.},

  abstract = {Understanding how humans conceptualize and categorize natural objects offers critical insights into perception and cognition. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), a key question arises: can these models develop human-like object representations from linguistic and multimodal data? Here we combined behavioural and neuroimaging analyses to explore the relationship between object concept representations in LLMs and human cognition. We collected 4.7 million triplet judgements from LLMs and multimodal LLMs to derive low-dimensional embeddings that capture the similarity structure of 1,854 natural objects. The resulting 66-dimensional embeddings were stable, predictive and exhibited semantic clustering similar to human mental representations. Remarkably, the dimensions underlying these embeddings were interpretable, suggesting that LLMs and multimodal LLMs develop human-like conceptual representations of objects. Further analysis showed strong alignment between model embeddings and neural activity patterns in brain regions such as the extrastriate body area, parahippocampal place area, retrosplenial cortex and fusiform face area. This provides compelling evidence that the object representations in LLMs, although not identical to human ones, share fundamental similarities that reflect key aspects of human conceptual knowledge. Our findings advance the understanding of machine intelligence and inform the development of more human-like artificial cognitive systems.},

  abstract = {Many students are being left behind by an educational system that some people believe is in crisis. Improving educational outcomes will require efforts on many fronts, but a central premise of this monograph is that one part of a solution involves helping students to better regulate their learning through the use of effective learning techniques. Fortunately, cognitive and educational psychologists have been developing and evaluating easy-to-use learning techniques that could help students achieve their learning goals. In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning techniques in detail and offer recommendations about their relative utility. We selected techniques that were expected to be relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by many students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading) were selected because students report relying heavily on them, which makes it especially important to examine how well they work. The techniques include elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining), the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, rereading, practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice. To offer recommendations about the relative utility of these techniques, we evaluated whether their benefits generalize across four categories of variables: learning conditions, student characteristics, materials, and criterion tasks. Learning conditions include aspects of the learning environment in which the technique is implemented, such as whether a student studies alone or with a group. Student characteristics include variables such as age, ability, and level of prior knowledge. Materials vary from simple concepts to mathematical problems to complicated science texts. Criterion tasks include different outcome measures that are relevant to student achievement, such as those tapping memory, problem solving, and comprehension. We attempted to provide thorough reviews for each technique, so this monograph is rather lengthy. However, we also wrote the monograph in a modular fashion, so it is easy to use. In particular, each review is divided into the following sections: General description of the technique and why it should work How general are the effects of this technique? {$\quad$}2a. Learning conditions {$\quad$}2b. Student characteristics {$\quad$}2c. Materials {$\quad$}2d. Criterion tasks Effects in representative educational contexts Issues for implementation Overall assessment The review for each technique can be read independently of the others, and particular variables of interest can be easily compared across techniques. To foreshadow our final recommendations, the techniques vary widely with respect to their generalizability and promise for improving student learning. Practice testing and distributed practice received high utility assessments because they benefit learners of different ages and abilities and have been shown to boost students' performance across many criterion tasks and even in educational contexts. Elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaved practice received moderate utility assessments. The benefits of these techniques do generalize across some variables, yet despite their promise, they fell short of a high utility assessment because the evidence for their efficacy is limited. For instance, elaborative interrogation and self-explanation have not been adequately evaluated in educational contexts, and the benefits of interleaving have just begun to be systematically explored, so the ultimate effectiveness of these techniques is currently unknown. Nevertheless, the techniques that received moderate-utility ratings show enough promise for us to recommend their use in appropriate situations, which we describe in detail within the review of each technique. Five techniques received a low utility assessment: summarization, highlighting, the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, and rereading. These techniques were rated as low utility for numerous reasons. Summarization and imagery use for text learning have been shown to help some students on some criterion tasks, yet the conditions under which these techniques produce benefits are limited, and much research is still needed to fully explore their overall effectiveness. The keyword mnemonic is difficult to implement in some contexts, and it appears to benefit students for a limited number of materials and for short retention intervals. Most students report rereading and highlighting, yet these techniques do not consistently boost students' performance, so other techniques should be used in their place (e.g., practice testing instead of rereading). Our hope is that this monograph will foster improvements in student learning, not only by showcasing which learning techniques are likely to have the most generalizable effects but also by encouraging researchers to continue investigating the most promising techniques. Accordingly, in our closing remarks, we discuss some issues for how these techniques could be implemented by teachers and students, and we highlight directions for future research.},

Previous research has shown that people generally have difficulty distinguishing AI-generated from human-written texts; however, the ability of teachers to identify an AI-generated text among student essays has not yet been investigated. Here we show in two experimental studies that novice (N = 89) and experienced teachers (N = 200) could not identify texts generated by ChatGPT among student-written texts. However, there are some indications that more experienced teachers made more differ­ entiated and more accurate judgments. Furthermore, both groups were overconfident in their judgments. Effects of real and assumed source on quality assessment were heterogeneous. Our findings demonstrate that with relatively little prompting, current AI can generate texts that are not detectable for teachers, which poses a challenge to schools and universities in grading student essays. Our study provides empirical evidence for the current debate regarding exam strategies in schools and universities in light of the latest technological developments.},

  abstract = {Flipped teaching and learning approaches are being increasingly used in higher education. Some advantages associated with the approach include providing opportunity for self-directed learning and enhanced collaboration between students. In this study, an implementation of a flipped approach in a first year foundational engineering dynamics course was researched to investigate student views on independent and collaborative learning inherent in flipped learning. Eighteen undergraduate students (11 male and 7 female) participated in this qualitative study. The flipped part of the course was designed to include self-paced independent learning and in-class learning, with opportunities to collaborate, ask questions, and work on examples. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews. The results of the study indicated that students universally enjoyed learning independently and appreciated the increased collaboration induced by the flipped approach. The flexibility of the approach enabled a range of approaches to independent learning and collaboration, and students were able to find learning styles that suited them. This article concludes with a range of recommendations for practice to further support independent and collaborative learning with the use of flipped approaches.},

  abstract = {Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5\$\textbackslash times\$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.},

This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.},

This critical synthesis compares artificial expertise and human expertise and examines ways in which generative chatbots can support cognition using an expert thinking framework. Findings indicate that generative chatbots may support experts’ cognition as a collaborator or to offload lower level tasks. Moreover, generative chatbots are a promising training tool in developing future experts in part because they can provide learning models and practice opportunities. The use of generative chatbots to offload lower level tasks, however, may harm expert development by disrupting knowledge communities. Finally, a lack of domain knowledge in nonexpert users may limit the effectiveness of generative chatbots in supporting higher level cognition and agency. Overall, existing research suggests that the potential for generative chatbots to support users’ cognition depends on a user’s level of expertise.

  author = {Kalai, Adam Tauman and Nachum, Ofir and Vempala, Santosh S and Zhang, Edwin},
  abstract = {Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of admitting uncertainty. Such “hallucinations” persist even in state-of-the-art systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious—they originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded—language models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain improves test performance. This “epidemic” of penalizing uncertain responses can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards, rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.},

Instead of only looking at extreme comparisons between discovery learning and direct instruction, an analysis of the four design possibilities suggests a vast design space in between the two extremes that may be more productive for learning than the extremes. I show that even though direct instruction can be conceived as a productive success compared to discovery learning, theoretical and empirical analyses suggests that it may well be an unproductive success compared with examples of productive failure and productive success.

  abstract = {Advances in generative artificial intelligence (GAI) show great potential for improving education. Yet little is known about how this new technology should be used and how effective it can be. Here we report a randomized, controlled study measuring college students’ learning and their perceptions when content is presented through an AI-powered tutor compared with an active learning class. The AI tutor was developed with the same pedagogical best practices as the lectures. We find that students learn more than twice as much in less time when using an AI tutor, compared with the active learning class. They also feel more engaged and more motivated. These findings offer empirical evidence for the efficacy of a widely accessible AI-powered pedagogy in significantly enhancing learning outcomes, presenting a compelling case for its broad adoption in learning environments. *These authors contributed equally to this work.

  abstract = {How do learners make decisions about how, what, and when to study, and why are their decisions sometimes ineffective for learning? In three studies, learners experienced a pair of contrasting study strategies (Study 1: interleaved vs. blocked schedule; Studies 2 \& 3: retrieval practice vs. restudy) and rated their perceptions of each strategy before choosing one for future use. In all three studies, mediation analysis revealed that participants who perceived a strategy as more effortful rated it as less effective for learning and, in turn, were less likely to choose it for future study. Further, choosing the more effortful strategy was associated with better long-term retention (Study 3), contrary to participants’ judgments. A final fourth study suggested that these relationships were not driven by the mere act of providing ratings. Our results thus support a misinterpreted-effort hypothesis in which the mental effort associated with many normatively effective learning strategies (desirable difficulties; Bjork \& Bjork, 1992) leads learners to misinterpret them as ineffective for learning and consequently not to employ them in self- regulated learning.},

This cognitive architecture consists of a limited working memory (WM), which interacts with a comparatively unlimited long-term memory (LTM). The limited WM carries the risk of learners being cognitively overloaded when performing a high complexity task. According to the theory, the limitations of working memory can be circumvented by coding multiple elements of information as one element in cognitive schemata, by automating rules, and by using  more than one presentation modality.},

The advantage of guidance begins to recede only when learners have sufficiently high prior knowledge to provide "internal" guidance.

Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.},

  abstract = {To make sense of the world around us, we must be able to segment a continual stream of sensory inputs into discrete events. In this review, I propose that in order to comprehend events, we engage hierarchical generative models that “reverse engineer” the intentions of other agents as they produce sequential action in real time. By generating probabilistic predictions for upcoming events, generative models ensure that we are able to keep up with the rapid pace at which perceptual inputs unfold. By tracking our certainty about other agents' goals and the magnitude of prediction errors at multiple temporal scales, generative models enable us to detect event boundaries by inferring when a goal has changed. Moreover, by adapting flexibly to the broader dynamics of the environment and our own comprehension goals, generative models allow us to optimally allocate limited resources. Finally, I argue that we use generative models not only to comprehend events but also to produce events (carry out goal-relevant sequential action) and to continually learn about new events from our surroundings. Taken together, this hierarchical generative framework provides new insights into how the human brain processes events so effortlessly while highlighting the fundamental links between event comprehension, production, and learning.},

  abstract = {Nearly three-quarters of college students cheat during their undergraduate careers, a startling number attributed variously to the laziness of today’s students, their lack of a moral compass, or the demands of a hypercompetitive society. For James Lang, cultural or sociological explanations like these are red herrings. His provocative new research indicates that students often cheat because their learning environments give them ample incentives to try—and that strategies which make cheating less worthwhile also improve student learning. Cheating Lessons is a practical guide to tackling academic dishonesty at its roots.Drawing on an array of findings from cognitive theory, Lang analyzes the specific, often hidden features of course design and daily classroom practice that create opportunities for cheating. Courses that set the stakes of performance very high, that rely on single assessment mechanisms like multiple-choice tests, that have arbitrary grading criteria: these are the kinds of conditions that breed cheating. Lang seeks to empower teachers to create more effective learning environments that foster intrinsic motivation, promote mastery, and instill the sense of self-efficacy that students need for deep learning.Although cheating is a persistent problem, the prognosis is not dire. The good news is that strategies which reduce cheating also improve student performance overall. Instructors who learn to curb academic dishonesty will have done more than solve a course management problem—they will have become better educators all around.},

In this article, evidence and arguments that support either of the approaches are reviewed. Also, we review how different instructional approaches interact with other instructional factors that have been known to be important, such as individual difference, selfexplanation, and comparison.

  abstract = {Bayesian models of cognition have gained considerable traction in computational neuroscience and psychiatry. Their scopes are now expected to expand rapidly to artificial intelligence, providing general inference frameworks to support embodied, adaptable, and energy-efficient autonomous agents. A central theory in this domain is predictive coding, which posits that learning and behaviour are driven by hierarchical probabilistic inferences about the causes of sensory inputs. Biological realism constrains these networks to rely on simple local computations in the form of precision-weighted predictions and prediction errors. This can make this framework highly efficient, but its implementation comes with unique challenges on the software development side. Embedding such models in standard neural network libraries often becomes limiting, as these libraries' compilation and differentiation backends can force a conceptual separation between optimization algorithms and the systems being optimized. This critically departs from other biological principles such as self-monitoring, self-organisation, cellular growth and functional plasticity. In this paper, we introduce \textbackslash texttt\{pyhgf\}: a Python package backed by JAX and Rust for creating, manipulating and sampling dynamic networks for predictive coding. We improve over other frameworks by enclosing the network components as transparent, modular and malleable variables in the message-passing steps. The resulting graphs can implement arbitrary computational complexities as beliefs propagation. But the transparency of core variables can also translate into inference processes that leverage self-organisation principles, and express structure learning, meta-learning or causal discovery as the consequence of network structural adaptation to surprising inputs.

  abstract = {Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) is a commonly used approach for student modeling, and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a versatile model that can be applied to a wide range of tasks, such as language translation. In this work, we directly compared three models: BKT, its variant Intervention-BKT (IBKT), and LSTM, on two types of student modeling tasks: post-test scores prediction and learning gains prediction. Additionally, while previous work on student learning has often used skill/knowledge components identified by domain experts, we incorporated an automatic skill discovery method (SK), which includes a nonparametric prior over the exercise-skill assignments, to all three models. Thus, we explored a total of six models: BKT, BKT+SK, IBKT, IBKT+SK, LSTM, and LSTM+SK. Two training datasets were employed, one was collected from a natural language physics intelligent tutoring system named Cordillera, and the other was from a standard probability intelligent tutoring system named Pyrenees. Overall, our results showed that BKT and BKT+SK outperformed the others on predicting post-test scores, whereas LSTM and LSTM+SK achieved the highest accuracy, F1-measure, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) on predicting learning gains. Furthermore, we demonstrated that by combining SK with the BKT model, BKT+SK could reliably predict post-test scores using only the earliest 50\% of the entire training sequences. For learning gain early prediction, using the earliest 70\% of the entire sequences, LSTM can deliver a comparable prediction as using the entire training sequences. The findings yield a learning environment that can foretell students’ performance and learning gains early, and can render adaptive pedagogical strategy accordingly.},

  abstract = {This chapter offers the first neuroscience-based theory linking the reversal of the Flynn Effect—documented declines in IQ scores across high-income countries since the 1970s—to the growing prevalence of cognitive offloading and pedagogical trends that minimize direct knowledge acquisition. Drawing on cognitive neuroscience, learning theory, and memory systems research, we argue that widespread underuse of the brain’s declarative and procedural systems has weakened internal representations—schemata—that are essential for reasoning, intuition, and expertise. We examine how shifts toward digital dependency and constructivist educational models have reduced opportunities for repeated retrieval, proceduralization, and the formation of robust engrams and neural manifolds. These trends disrupt the consolidation and automatization of biologically secondary knowledge, impairing schema-driven prediction, error correction, and transfer. We propose that the weakening of these memory systems—long before neurodegeneration sets in—may explain recent cognitive declines more plausibly than purely environmental or genetic accounts. The chapter closes by outlining implications for cognitive theory, educational practice, and AI-era learning environments. Rather than viewing memory as outdated in a world of instant information access, we argue that internal knowledge remains foundational for deep learning and that cognitive augmentation requires—not replaces—biological memory.},

However, while technological innovation is enabling unprecedented open access to high quality educational material, these systems generally inherit similar homework, exams, and instructional resources to that of their classroom counterparts and currently lack an underlying model with which to talk about learning. In this paper we will show how existing learner modeling techniques based on Bayesian Knowledge Tracing can be adapted to the inaugural course, 6.002x: circuit design, on the edX MOOC platform. We identify three distinct challenges to modeling MOOC data and provide predictive evaluations of the respective modeling approach to each challenge. The challenges identified are; lack of an explicit knowledge component model, allowance for unpenalized multiple problem attempts, and multiple pathways through the system that allow for learning influences outside of the current assessment.},

  abstract = {Knowledge tracing---where a machine models the knowledge of a student as they interact with coursework---is a well established problem in computer supported education. Though effectively modeling student knowledge would have high educational impact, the task has many inherent challenges. In this paper we explore the utility of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model student learning. The RNN family of models have important advantages over previous methods in that they do not require the explicit encoding of human domain knowledge, and can capture more complex representations of student knowledge. Using neural networks results in substantial improvements in prediction performance on a range of knowledge tracing datasets. Moreover the learned model can be used for intelligent curriculum design and allows straightforward interpretation and discovery of structure in student tasks. These results suggest a promising new line of research for knowledge tracing and an exemplary application task for RNNs.},

Despite its general effectiveness, in a growing number of studies, prompting for self-explanation improved some aspects of learning, but reduced learning of other aspects. Drawing on this recent research, as well as on research comparing self-explanation under different conditions, we propose four constraints on the effectiveness of self-explanation. First, self-explanation promotes attention to particular types of information, so it is better suited to promote particular learning outcomes in particular types of domains, such as transfer in domains guided by general principles or heuristics. Second, self-explaining a variety of types of information can improve learning, but explaining one’s own solution methods or choices may reduce learning under certain conditions. Third, explanation prompts focus effort on particular aspects of the to-be-learned material, potentially drawing effort away from other important information. Explanation prompts must be carefully designed to align with target learning outcomes. Fourth, prompted self-explanation often promotes learning better than unguided studying, but alternative instructional techniques may be more effective under some conditions. Attention to these constraints should optimize the effectiveness of self-explanation as an instructional technique in future research and practice.},

Retrieval practice is often effective even without feedback (i.e. giving the correct answer), but feedback enhances the benefits of testing. In addition, retrieval practice promotes the acquisition of knowledge that can be flexibly retrieved and transferred to different contexts. The power of retrieval practice in consolidating memories has important implications for both the study of memory and its application to educational practice.},

Students then took a final retention test 5 min, 2 days, or 1 week later. When the final test was given after 5 min, repeated studying improved recall relative to repeated testing. However, on the delayed tests, prior testing produced substantially greater retention than studying, even though repeated studying increased students' confidence in their ability to remember the material. Testing is a powerful means of improving learning, not just assessing it.},

For instance, they might mistake one word for another word with a similar spelling (e.g., allusion instead of illusion) or choose the wrong strategy for a mathematics problem because it resembles a different kind of problem. By one proposition explored in this review, these kinds of errors occur more frequently when all exposures to one of the concepts are grouped together. For instance, in most middle school science texts, the questions in each assignment are devoted to the same concept, and this blocking of exposures ensures that students need not learn to distinguish between two similar concepts. In an alternative approach described in this review, exposures to each concept are interleaved with exposures to other concepts, so that a question on one concept is followed by a question on a different concept. In a number of experiments that have compared interleaving and blocking, interleaving produced better scores on final tests of learning. The evidence is limited, though, and ecologically valid studies are needed. Still, a prudent reading of the data suggests that at least a portion of the exposures should be interleaved.},

Up until now, tracing student knowledge and analyzing misconceptions has been difficult and time-consuming to implement for open-ended dialogue tutoring. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be supportive of this task: we first use LLM prompting methods to identify the knowledge components/skills involved in each dialogue turn, i.e., a tutor utterance posing a task or a student utterance that responds to it. We also evaluate whether the student responds correctly to the tutor and verify the LLM's accuracy using human expert annotations. We then apply a range of knowledge tracing (KT) methods on the resulting labeled data to track student knowledge levels over an entire dialogue. We conduct experiments on two tutoring dialogue datasets, and show that a novel yet simple LLM-based method, LLMKT, significantly outperforms existing KT methods in predicting student response correctness in dialogues. We perform extensive qualitative analyses to highlight the challenges in dialogueKT and outline multiple avenues for future work.},

  abstract = {Recent generations of frontier language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established mathematical and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from data contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces’ structure and quality. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of compositional complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs “think”. Through extensive experimentation across diverse puzzles, we show that frontier LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having an adequate token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM counterparts under equivalent inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) lowcomplexity tasks where standard models surprisingly outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity tasks where additional thinking in LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models experience complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models’ computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and ultimately raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities.},

Noting that there is a passionate debate about the design of initial learning, we report evidence from a meta-analysis of 53 studies with 166 comparisons that compared PS-I with I-PS design. Our results showed a significant, moderate effect in favor of PS-I (Hedge’s g 0.36 [95\% confidence interval 0.20; 0.51]). The effects were even stronger (Hedge’s g ranging between 0.37 and 0.58) when PS-I was implemented with high fidelity to the principles of Productive Failure (PF), a subset variant of PS-I design. Students’ grade level, intervention time span, and its (quasi-)experimental nature contributed to the efficacy of PS-I over I-PS designs. Contrasting trends were, however, observed for younger age learners (second to fifth graders) and for the learning of domain-general skills, for which effect sizes favored I-PS. Overall, an estimation of true effect sizes after accounting for publication bias suggested a strong effect size favoring PS-I (Hedge’s g 0.87).},

A total of 91 university students were randomly assigned to either use ChatGPT3.5 or Google to research the socio-scientific issue of nanoparticles in sunscreen to derive valid recommendations and justifications. The study aimed to investigate potential differences in cognitive load, as well as the quality and homogeneity of the students' recommendations and justifications. Results indicated that students using LLMs experienced significantly lower cognitive load. However, despite this reduction, these students demonstrated lower-quality reasoning and argumentation in their final recommendations compared to those who used traditional search engines. Further, the homogeneity of the recommendations and justifications did not differ significantly between the two groups, suggesting that LLMs did not restrict the diversity of students’ perspectives. These findings highlight the nuanced implications of digital tools on learning, suggesting that while LLMs can decrease the cognitive burden associated with information gathering during a learning task, they may not promote deeper engagement with content necessary for high-quality learning per se.},

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory has been in development since the 1980s. Much of the impetus for that development has come from firstly, replication failures using randomised controlled trials and secondly, from the incorporation of other theories into cognitive load theory. Both have led to theory expansion. The immediate cause of the so-called “replication crisis” in psychology and other disciplines is a failure to replicate previous empirical findings. Using cognitive load theory as an example, I argue that the appearance of contradictory evidence does not necessarily derive from a failure to properly collect data. Rather, it can be caused by initially insufficiently detailed theories, with increasing detail often revealing the reason for a failure to replicate. For cognitive load theory, each failure to replicate, rather than being a negative, contributed to the further development of the theory. In addition, the theory has developed over many years by closely incorporating other theories associated with human cognitive architecture and evolutionary psychology. In this paper, I discuss some of the developmental milestones associated with cognitive load theory and how they were informed by replication failures and theory integration.},

AI-assisted researchers discover 44\% more materials, resulting in a 39\% increase in patent filings and a 17\% rise in downstream product innovation. These compounds possess more novel chemical structures and lead to more radical inventions. However, the technology has strikingly disparate effects across the productivity distribution: while the bottom third of scientists see little benefit, the output of top researchers nearly doubles. Investigating the mechanisms behind these results, I show that AI automates 57\% of "idea-generation" tasks, reallocating researchers to the new task of evaluating model-produced candidate materials. Top scientists leverage their domain knowledge to prioritize promising AI suggestions, while others waste significant resources testing false positives. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of AI-augmented research and highlight the complementarity between algorithms and expertise in the innovative process. Survey evidence reveals that these gains come at a cost, however, as 82\% of scientists report reduced satisfaction with their work due to decreased creativity and skill underutilization.},

The results indicate that ChatGPT has a large positive impact on improving learning performance (g\,=\,0.867) and a moderately positive impact on enhancing learning perception (g\,=\,0.456) and fostering higher-order thinking (g\,=\,0.457). The impact of ChatGPT on learning performance was moderated by type of course (QB\,=\,64.249, P\,{$<$}\,0.001), learning model (QB\,=\,76.220, P\,{$<$}\,0.001), and duration (QB\,=\,55.998, P\,{$<$}\,0.001); its effect on learning perception was moderated by duration (QB\,=\,19.839, P\,{$<$}\,0.001); and its influence on the development of higher-order thinking was moderated by type of course (QB\,=\,7.811, P\,{$<$}\,0.05) and the role played by ChatGPT (QB\,=\,4.872, P\,{$<$}\,0.05). This study suggests that: (1) appropriate learning scaffolds or educational frameworks (e.g., Bloom’s taxonomy) should be provided when using ChatGPT to develop students’ higher-order thinking; (2) the broad use of ChatGPT at various grade levels and in different types of courses should be encouraged to support diverse learning needs; (3) ChatGPT should be actively integrated into different learning modes to enhance student learning, especially in problem-based learning; (4) continuous use of ChatGPT should be ensured to support student learning, with a recommended duration of 4–8 weeks for more stable effects; (5) ChatGPT should be flexibly integrated into teaching as an intelligent tutor, learning partner, and educational tool. Finally, due to the limited sample size for learning perception and higher-order thinking, and the moderately positive effect, future studies with expanded scope should further explore how to use ChatGPT more effectively to cultivate students’ learning perception and higher-order thinking.},

To provide a framework for studying such conversation structure, we introduce Problem-Oriented Segmentation \& Retrieval (POSR), the task of jointly breaking down conversations into segments and linking each segment to the relevant reference item. As a case study, we apply POSR to education where effectively structuring lessons around problems is critical yet difficult. We present LessonLink, the first dataset of real-world tutoring lessons, featuring 3,500 segments, spanning 24,300 minutes of instruction and linked to 116 SAT math problems. We define and evaluate several joint and independent approaches for POSR, including segmentation (e.g., TextTiling), retrieval (e.g., ColBERT), and large language models (LLMs) methods. Our results highlight that modeling POSR as one joint task is essential: POSR methods outperform independent segmentation and retrieval pipelines by up to +76\% on joint metrics and surpass traditional segmentation methods by up to +78\% on segmentation metrics. We demonstrate POSR's practical impact on downstream education applications, deriving new insights on the language and time use in real-world lesson structures.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian models of perception and learning feature prominently in contemporary cognitive neuroscience where, for example, they inform computational concepts of mental disorders. This includes predictive coding and hierarchical Gaussian filtering (HGF), which differ in the nature of hierarchical representations. Predictive coding assumes that higher levels in a given hierarchy influence the state (value) of lower levels. In HGF, however, higher levels determine the rate of change at lower levels. Here, we extend the space of generative models underlying HGF to include a form of nonlinear hierarchical coupling between state values akin to predictive coding and artificial neural networks in general. We derive the update equations corresponding to this generalization of HGF and conceptualize them as connecting a network of (belief) nodes where parent nodes either predict the state of child nodes or their rate of change. This enables us to (1) create modular architectures with generic computational steps in each node of the network, and (2) disclose the hierarchical message passing implied by generalized HGF models and to compare this to comparable schemes under predictive coding. We find that the algorithmic architecture instantiated by the generalized HGF is largely compatible with that of predictive coding but extends it with some unique predictions which arise from precision and volatility related computations. Our developments enable highly flexible implementations of hierarchical Bayesian models for empirical data analysis and are available as open source software.},

  abstract = {Background As researchers rush to investigate the potential of AI tools like ChatGPT to enhance learning, well-documented pitfalls threaten the validity of this emerging research. Issues of media comparison research, where the confounding of instructional methods and technological affordances is unrecognised, may render effects uninterpretable. Objectives Using a recent meta-analysis by Deng et al. (Computers \& Education, 227, 105224) as an example, we revisit key insights from the media/methods debate to highlight recurring conceptual challenges in ChatGPT efficacy studies. Methods This conceptual article contrasts nascent ChatGPT research with the more established literature on Intelligent Tutoring Systems to identify three non-negotiable considerations for interpretable effects: (1) descriptions of the precise nature of the experimental treatment and (2) the activities of the control group, as well as (3) outcome measures as valid indicators of learning. To provide some initial evidence, we audited a subset of primary experiments included in Deng et al.'s meta-analysis, demonstrating that only a small minority of studies satisfied all three non-negotiable considerations. Results and Conclusions Loosely defined treatments, mismatched or opaque controls, and outcome measures with unclear links to durable learning obscure causal claims of this emerging literature. Observed gains cannot, at this time, be confidently attributed to ChatGPT, and meta-analytics effect sizes may over- or understate its benefits. Progress, we argue, will require rigorous designs, transparent reporting, and a critical stance toward “fast science.”},

  abstract = {A meta-analysis (435 studies, k = 994, N {$>$} 61,000) of empirical research on the effects of feedback on student learning was conducted with the purpose of replicating and expanding the Visible Learning research (Hattie \& Timperley, 2007; Hattie, 2009; Hattie \& Zierer, 2019) from meta-synthesis. Overall results based on a random-effects model indicate a medium effect (d = 0.48) of feedback on student learning, but the significant heterogeneity in the data shows that feedback cannot be understood as a single consistent form of treatment. A moderator analysis revealed that the impact is substantially influenced by the information content conveyed. Furthermore, feedback has higher impact on cognitive and motor skills outcomes than on motivational and behavioral outcomes. We discuss these findings in the light of the assumptions made in The power of feedback (Hattie \& Timperley, 2007). In general, the results suggest that feedback has rightly become a focus of teaching research and practice. However, they also point towards the necessity of interpreting different forms of feedback as independent measures.},

Recent large language models (LLMs) challenge the necessity of grounding for concept formation: whether LLMs without grounding nevertheless exhibit human-like representations. Here we compare multidimensional representations of \textasciitilde 4,442 lexical concepts between humans (the Glasgow Norms1, N\,=\,829; and the Lancaster Norms2, N\,=\,3,500) and state-of-the-art LLMs with and without visual learning, across non-sensorimotor, sensory and motor domains. We found that (1) the similarity between model and human representations decreases from non-sensorimotor to sensory domains and is minimal in motor domains, indicating a systematic divergence, and (2) models with visual learning exhibit enhanced similarity with human representations in visual-related dimensions. These results highlight the potential limitations of language in isolation for LLMs and that the integration of diverse modalities can potentially enhance alignment with human conceptual representation.},

  abstract = {Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim, examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53\% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0\% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in code-centric LLM reasoning.},

  abstract = {People often give instructions whose meaning is ambiguous without further context, expecting that their actions or goals will disambiguate their intentions. How can we build assistive agents that follow such instructions in a flexible, context-sensitive manner? This paper introduces cooperative language-guided inverse plan search (CLIPS), a Bayesian agent architecture for pragmatic instruction following and goal assistance. Our agent assists a human by modeling them as a cooperative planner who communicates joint plans to the assistant, then performs multimodal Bayesian inference over the human's goal from actions and language, using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the likelihood of an instruction given a hypothesized plan. Given this posterior, our assistant acts to minimize expected goal achievement cost, enabling it to pragmatically follow ambiguous instructions and provide effective assistance even when uncertain about the goal. We evaluate these capabilities in two cooperative planning domains (Doors, Keys \& Gems and VirtualHome), finding that CLIPS significantly outperforms GPT-4V, LLM-based literal instruction following and unimodal inverse planning in both accuracy and helpfulness, while closely matching the inferences and assistive judgments provided by human raters.},

  abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems optimize the selection and timing of learning materials to enhance understanding and long-term retention. This requires estimates of both the learner's progress ("knowledge tracing"; KT), and the prerequisite structure of the learning domain ("knowledge mapping"). While recent deep learning models achieve high KT accuracy, they do so at the expense of the interpretability of psychologically-inspired models. In this work, we present a solution to this trade-off. PSI-KT is a hierarchical generative approach that explicitly models how both individual cognitive traits and the prerequisite structure of knowledge influence learning dynamics, thus achieving interpretability by design. Moreover, by using scalable Bayesian inference, PSI-KT targets the real-world need for efficient personalization even with a growing body of learners and interaction data. Evaluated on three datasets from online learning platforms, PSI-KT achieves superior multi-step **p**redictive accuracy and **s**calable inference in continual-learning settings, all while providing **i**nterpretable representations of learner-specific traits and the prerequisite structure of knowledge that causally supports learning. In sum, predictive, scalable and interpretable knowledge tracing with solid knowledge mapping lays a key foundation for effective personalized learning to make education accessible to a broad, global audience.},
