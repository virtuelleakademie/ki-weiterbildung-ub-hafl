title: "How Humans Learn"
---
This presentation reveals why offloading cognitive processing to AI can undermine the development of genuine expertise. Through ACT-R [@andersonAdaptiveCharacterThought2013; @andersonHowCanHuman2007] theory, it explains how learning transforms declarative knowledge into procedural skills via productive struggle. The process involves grappling with confusion, making mistakes, and adjusting strategies—steps that are easily bypassed when using AI.

**The key takeaway:** Struggling, confusion and effort aren't obstacles to learning---they're the very mechanisms that
  build lasting expertise.
